as if i didn???t understand. i told her yes i brought one. she then told me if it doesn???t show up on your rewards their is nothing she can do. even though the email she read was cut and dried. her response was you can call the 1-800# for help. so to prove myself, i sat at the store, called and discussed with customer service who said have the manager override it. i told them amanda couldn???t help and referred me to call customer service. when i asked amanda if she could talk to customer service she didn???t refuse but her face expression said it all, as she was very displeased with the call. she gets off the phone and says ok i???ll override it, let me scan your card. when she did she noticed i already had enough points to cover more than free coffee. so instead of overriding it to honor a free coffee promotion, she redeemed my existing points for a coffee. when i show her the receipt and told her what she did, she said with a cold face, oh well you have to call the 1-800 number and they???ll give you back your points. no apology. so again i called. it took a few weeks and few calls to just get my points back. i???ve called multiple times about adding the reward for a free month of coffee. still not fixed! i???ve called 3 times and the last time i was told you don???t have to call we already have a ticket and will fix it but can???t give you a timeline of when. someone will call you. still have not received a call. also. i emailed the customer service email address and no one has responded. i guess customer service isn???t a priority even at a higher level. so fast forward to today. my kids asked if we can go today and decided to put my differences aside and go. we place an order on one cash register and moved to the other to pay to find amanda again taking payments. i placed my phone with the app open for her to scan the reward card before my payment and gave her my card for payment, she ran the card without scanning my reward card on my phone. then when i questioned it, she gave me that bad attitude again and said something between the line of oh, hard luck, you should have gave the reward card first when it was clear that card was open on my phone in front of her to scan. i honestly feel that some managers are worthless and ruthless while their employees are much compassionate and helpful which is a live true case at einstein bagels of middleburg heights. who???s my experience mainly revolved around a silly reward; it???s never about the free coffee but rather at the reception, service and treatment you receive at a business. it???s much more about caring for your costumers and providing the best service you possibly could. i doubt i will go again or recommend it to anyone.",1553775179,"use love come middleburg height locat past month problem last month receiv email state bring travel mug get free coffe plus free refil month decid could go travel mug grab someth eat util coffe reward surpris offer show reward unknown reason show email receiv figur process call manag amanda help woho helper call seem like annoy even call help told realiz onli bring travel mug understand told yes brought one told show reward noth even though email read cut dri respons call help prove sat store call discuss custom servic said manag overrid told amanda help refer call custom servic ask amanda could talk custom servic refus face express said veri displeas call get phone say ok overrid let scan card notic alreadi enough point cover free coffe instead overrid honor free coffe promot redeem exist point coffe show receipt told said cold face oh well call number give back point apolog call took week call get point back call multipl time ad reward free month coffe still fix call time last time told call alreadi ticket fix give timelin someon call still receiv call also email custom servic email address one respond guess custom servic prioriti even higher level fast forward today kid ask go today decid put differ asid go place order one cash regist move pay find amanda take payment place phone app open scan reward card befor payment gave card payment ran card without scan reward card phone question gave bad attitud said someth line oh hard luck gave reward card first clear card open phone front scan honest feel manag worthless ruthless employe much compassion help live true case einstein bagel middleburg height experi main revolv around silli reward never free coffe rather recept servic treatment receiv busi much care costum provid best servic possibl could doubt go recommend anyon"," bagels",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.3800569,-81.7850107,"OH","middleburg heights","44130","6799 Pearl Rd","einstein bros. bagels"

a year or so ago they decided to stop offering buffets... it didn't take much time to realize the place was always empty with no customers. after what seemed as suffering substantial business lose passage to india switched back to the normal delicious buffet we have always been used to.
 
being told i would have to come on weekends and pay more than the regular  for  a non-vegetarian option than chicken, i've been doing so but today i was surprised to know that there was non of that (no usual goat stew or rice) 
i asked for a manager but wasn't transferred to anyone and when explaining myself i was told they have no goat in the restaurant and i only had the option of what was out

one person added that they had lamb but they cannot offer it.

still unfortunately at checkout i paid the weekend buffet rate.

all in all, it's a decent, affordable place to spend time with friends and family (or other large groups), but don't expect the pizza to rock you.

well. apparently at this location they either have no clue what they are doing (the idiots making sandwiches don't know how to make sandwiches in general) or are just out to rip off customers as much as possible.

they smashed and tore my wife's bread open. they then use as little meat as possible and made four separate areas of folded meat.
when it came to my meatball (regular price $5.95 - with choice of cheese included for free), i wanted the ultimate cheesy garlic bread ($7.59 - additional charge for the garlic spread and melted cheeses on the bread). 
the employee just made a few large blobs of the garlic spread - did not spread it out across the entire bread. he then (without melting the spread and cheese) put the meatballs and (about a gallon) sauce. the rude female employee then asked if i wanted it toasted.  i said it should have been toasted before the meatballs were put on. (if i decided not to toast it, i would have been eating cold cheese and blobs of cold garlic spread!!) she said it can be done either way, this is the way we do it. (there is no way that garlic spread and cheese would have melted properly with the luke-warm meatballs and sauce piled on top) 
so, she toasts the sandwich. then she wraps it up. my wife asked why i didn't get cheese in my sandwich, and the female said ""there is cheese on there!"". my wife said ""no, we wanted provolone cheese"". we were told that we could not have provolone cheese since we got the cheesy garlic bread. i asked why i couldn't get cheese, and she said that i would be charged for extra cheese if i insisted on the provolone!!! now by this point, all of the sauce piled on my sandwich was oozing out everywhere and seeping out through the wrapper (she went ahead and wrapped it up, refusing to put any more cheese on the sandwich!!) they continued to argue with us and tell us that we have to pay extra if we want provolone. we tried explaining that the sandwich is already charged $1.59 more for the special bread. they insisted that because if the bread, i am not allowed to have any cheese other than the cheese used to make it ""ultimate cheesy"". 
she then called either the manager (or owner) and said that we ordered the sandwich,  and when we saw the price,  we wanted our money back. i said ""no, i just wanted the provolone (that the meatball is always available to be added for free) on my sandwich"". she then told the person on the phone that i want ""extra cheese"" but am refusing to pay the charge for extra cheese. i said i don't want extra cheese....i want the normally included cheese that the employee refuses to put on my sandwich.

the person on the phone then said just give them the money.  i said i didn't want the money. i just want to eat my sandwich the way i want (this is subway....i can make my sandwich the way i like it, correct?!?)

this is when i was told that i was not allowed to have my sandwich. she gave me my money and said - with a smug and ignorant tone - have a good night.

as we walked out of the store without my food,  the gentleman that made.my sandwich began arguing with me that he knows how to make a sandwich. he made it right.

we have had issues here before, and have witnessed issues leading to police being called.

based on the recommendations of other reviews, i made a reservation for the 4 of us on a friday evening. i'm really glad i did, too, because it got quite crowded! 

the atmosphere was cozy. the tables in my area are close enough that navigating to the bathroom was like navigating a waist-high hedge maze, but not so close that seating was uncomfortable. there's also a bar area with several tvs.

the food was good. i honestly don't remember what i ordered, but i'm pretty sure i ate it all. the menu is larger than i expected for a place so small, and it seems like a good mix of traditionally euro-american fare that is common in this region: burgers, fish, pasta, salads, etc. my friend took his leftover pasta home to his wife, and she told me she enjoyed it, too.

staff was friendly, drinks were prompt, our orders were correct, and other customers were loud (as per any neighborhood bar and grill on a friday evening) but certainly not impolite.

everyone in the group asked me if i'd been there before, because it definitely feels like a little cozy gem of a restaurant known mostly by locals. i can thank online reviews for pointing me here!",1548246938,"pick place dinner friend quit close event even altern option place call carnivor disqualifi exclus becaus want hear vegetarian group whine base recommend review made reserv us friday even realli glad becaus got quit crowd atmospher cozi tabl area close enough navig bathroom like navig waist high hedg maze close seat uncomfort also bar area sever tvs food good honest rememb order pretti sure ate menu larger expect place small seem like good mix tradit euro american fare common region burger fish pasta salad etc friend took leftov pasta home wife told enjoy staff friend drink prompt order correct custom loud per ani neighborhood bar grill friday even certain impolit everyon group ask befor becaus definit feel like littl cozi gem restaur known local thank onlin review point"," salad burgers vegetarian american",4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.5274082,-79.8421221,"PA","oakmont","15139","939 3rd St","mighty oak barrel"

we went and it was better than our past experience at mccormick ranch and not as expensive.  it was buffet style and had all the traditional varieties of food for thanksgiving.  the gravy and stuffing were excellent.  they also had a breakfast brunch buffet and a wonderful salad bar with specialty meats, salad, and cheeses, dessert table.  the buffet price included free champagne or mimosa's upon your arrival.  we would highly recommend annabelle's with it's vintage 1950's glamour and gorgeous chandeliers.  so, if you want atmosphere and fine dining it is here at annabelle.  they are also open for breakfast lunch and dinner daily with outdoor pool view patio seating. we definitely are going there again and again and it's so close.  i hope you take my recommendation and visit this restaurant so they can stay in business.  we need a fine dining place close to l.w.

this visit was our first time at this location, in summerlin.
to start things off, the hostess took our drink order, and they had no syrup in them. (coke) we let her know, and she had the guy fix the machine.
the (older lady) waitress finally took our order, after walking by us at our table several times.
 we ordered the prime rib specials. she brings us our soup, and we finish it, with still no drinks. the hostess (younger girl) walks by and says, ""oh, you guys still haven't gotten your drinks yet"", and we say nope. pretty upset by that point. it honestly felt as if because we weren't a regular customer of that location, that we were intentionally being ignored. especially since the older waitress made it a point to chat with every other couple she was helping.
our food finally comes out, after almost an hour, and both of our prime ribs were terribly dry. the green beans were cold, and the potato was almost there as well.
we aren't ones to complain, so we did not say anything. my wife could not eat hers, although i did try to eat mine. trying not to waste it.
a male waiter, and possibly manager came over to clear our plates and asked us how it was. i had to be honest and let him know the meat was very dry, so he said he would comp one. not what we were expecting, but a nice gesture. he asked our waitress if we mentioned it, and she said no. of course, because we didn't want to make it a big deal. he did still comp one, so that was nice of him.

small plates: at the suggestion of the waiter we went with the specials, yellowtail hamachi and braised crispy sweetbreads.  the yellowtail was fine in terms of texture though there was no real flavor of the candied lemon and jalapeno.  the sweetbreads were chewy, not crispy, and a bit slopped on the plate.  sauce on the sweetbreads was very good.

main course: again with one of the specials, the big eye tuna had no ""spicy ginger"" or ""braised greens"".  was also overcooked as the sear was grey going about a half inch into the center while being blackened on just one side.  the worst offender was the short rib udon.  best described as roast beef squares in the udon.  again with no taste of jalapeno the dish was a decent broth was nice greens and noodles but the meat absolutely was akin to a braised beef that was chopped up and tossed directly into a pot of broth to leech out all it's flavor and become a crock pot roast.

having grown up on the pacific coast, i am very used to fresh seafood and had high expectations from what i had read about the salt cellar.

when i dined here with my family, my high expectations were completely fulfilled. i was amazed at how fresh and good everything we had to eat was. 

my daughter got to pick out her very own lobster (which was the size of my forearm!).  she loved it, both as the food and the experience.

i ordered a plate of crab legs, and this is where things got fun. they bring out the tray, and these legs are huge, but then, the server cracked the crab for me! i've eaten a lot of crustacean, but haven't ever had someone open it for me.
it was fantastic! all the pleasure eating the crab (with butter and lemon of course) without any of the work of digging the meat out of the shell.

while i can't afford to eat here all that often, i'm sure i'll be back to the best seafood i've had in arizona.

mr. mccarthy ???
 
i wanted to apologize for the customer who brought a parrot into our store.  i agree that pets should not be allowed in restaurants however under arizona law we are not allowed to question the validity of a person???s service animal.  if a customer tells us their animal is a service animal, we must allow them to bring it into the store.
 
i apologize that my employee thought it was cool???they were wrong, however it is a very difficult situation that even with training, many quick-service employees are not comfortable handling, as it can turn confrontational very quickly, and result in legal action.
 
i will once again speak with my staff about service animals and the rights and laws protecting both the restaurant as well as the individuals with those needs.  if you can let me know which employee, even a brief description, i will specifically speak to them about it as well.
 
thank you
 
philip cohen

mr. cohen,

the restaurant employee did not bother to question the patron about whether or not the parrot was a service animal and i doubt that a parrot would qualify as such, although in this day and age, nothing would surprise me. so on that basis, i will spread the word that subway allows such animals in their restaurants based on the assumption that they are allowed under arizona law, whatever misconceived kind of law that would be.

personally, i would have told the patron to leave and return without the parrot. it???s as simple as that. he gets served, and other patrons are not bothered or offended.

the only reason i did not give 5 stars is because on 3 different occasions,  with one particular waitress, service has been slow.  you should not have to wait for a refill where the manager ends up having to come over to ask you if you want another drink when your empty glasses have been sitting at the edge of the table for 10 minutes, and then wait another 7 minutes after that.  the firepit is not that big in size that this should happen - it is an open dining room plan where all of the tables/booths can be seen by the wait staff.   you can have the best food in the world, but poor service will eventually start to have an effect.  

all in all though, never having a bad meal quality-wise  at the firepit, you should really should try them out, as the food does compensate for the occasional less-than-perfect service. we have been here at least 10 times now, and i still have not tried everything i want to try, and i have had something different every time.",1551029760,"husband self love firepit restaur go instead ani chain want stay within minut home food alway consist delici pic last visit thai sweet heat shrimp hard wood grill shrimp sweet chili thai sauc grill pineappl salsa fresh scallion char veget fri rice side wood fire cornbread husband oz center cut age sirloin smash potato roast roast onion alway start wood fire pretzel becaus yeah wood fire pretzel never bad meal firepit alway call go prime dinner time saturday reserv never wait onli reason give star becaus differ occas one particular waitress servic slow wait refil manag end come ask want anoth drink empti glass sit edg tabl minut wait anoth minut firepit big size happen open dine room plan tabl booth seen wait staff best food world poor servic eventu start effect though never bad meal qualiti wise firepit realli tri food doe compens occasion less perfect servic least time still tri everyth want tri someth differ everi time"," thai",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.321753,-79.689537,"PA","irwin","15642","8931 Lincoln Hwy","the firepit wood fired grill"

my personal favorite is the mexican stir fry, but classic favorites like enchiladas and tacos work just fine. the guacamole (which they will hand-make at your table) is awesome, if a bit pricey. the cost is welcome for the generous and delicious helping of guacamole you get.

first off, the weather was cold and everytime the front door opened i could feel a draft, even with double door entry. plus, we were sitting right in front of the kitchen, which is farthest from front door. they need to install a heater above the front door pushing the cold air down.
next, the clam chowder was not good. light red in color, and no flavor, yes absolutely no flavor. i had about 3 very fresh clams in it, but that was it. i have been to multiple seafood places on east and west coast, and claim chowder is my forte. this clam chowder needs work.

next, i got the drunken mushroom burger. the brioche bun was fantastic and so was the meat, but besides that it was very bland. it was suppose to have wine infused mushrooms, but only tasted it maybe in one or two bites. 

not too busy at 5:30 pm, and we had to hunt our waitress to order our food. she was great initially in taking our drink order and seeing if we wanted to get appetizers, but after that all down hill on getting service.

there was only 2 silverware settings for 5 of us and we asked for more. she came back with only one saying that is all they currently had? she never came back with more,,,good thing 3 of us had burgers. that meant we had no napkins for two people so i grabbed some paper ones on the shelves below where they serve the food to staff. again because we could not find our waitress.

what should of been a 35-45 minute dinner turned out to be an hour due to waiting to find our waitress again to get our bill and doggy bags. made us rush to our meeting at 7:15. 

so, if they correct the wait service, cold air blowing in and the clam chowder,  this place would get 5 stars. as i said, first visit 5 stars, i am generous at 3 with this visit.",1550019778,"eaten befor burger awesom bun fantast crew eat would star visit good first weather cold everytim front door open could feel draft even doubl door entri plus sit right front kitchen farthest front door need instal heater abov front door push cold air next clam chowder good light red color flavor yes absolut flavor veri fresh clam multipl seafood place east west coast claim chowder fort clam chowder need work next got drunken mushroom burger brioch bun fantast meat besid veri bland suppos wine infus mushroom onli tast mayb one two bite busi pm hunt waitress order food great initi take drink order see want get appet hill get servic onli silverwar set us ask came back onli one say current never came back good thing us burger meant napkin two peopl grab paper one shelv serv food staff becaus could find waitress minut dinner turn hour due wait find waitress get bill doggi bag made us rush meet correct wait servic cold air blow clam chowder place would get star said first visit star generous visit"," burgers seafood",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,43.1755043,-89.2079918,"WI","sun prairie","53590","836 Grove St","willie ty's eatery & bar"

weeks ago","updated with more detail- i would give zero stars if i could. very poor management. waited 1 hour 45 min for an order that was placed by a grubhub customer at 6:13pm. i arrived at 7pm as the grubhub courier and waited until 8pm and the order still was not ready. the owner flat out stated that he takes care of his customers though. the owner got in my face after i questioned what was taking so long and he stated to me that he didn't care if the customer cancels the order or not after i waited inside for 1 hour for nothing.  unbelievable.  the restaurant even took their phone off the hook while i was standing inside there waiting.  really sounds like he truly cares for his customers. i think not. the customer that i was trying to pick up food for was attempting to call the restaurant to see what was taking so long and i was told by the customer that they  could not get through.  i ended up walking out without getting the customer's food. the customer also ended up canceling their order through grubhub after i called the customer to inform them of the situation regarding the owner's poor attitude.  good luck if you choose to give this place your hard earned money. you might have to wait all night for it possibly to closing time maybe. you have been warned.  also, after reading several other reviews on various different platforms, looks like this owner has a history of putting the blame on the delivery services that he uses, saying the delivery companies are dropping the ball, but in reality, it's his own poor execution of properly staffing his business accordingly to meet demand on a friday night so a paying customer and a courier do not have to wait an incredibly ridiculous amount of time... very unprofessional and extremely poor service..... 3/22/2019 note to owner.  fyi- i did not get paid for the 1 hour that i waited inside your business on the customer's behalf due to the order not being delivered and ultimately being canceled by the customer.  i am not trying to hurt your business but only simply reporting my observations and personal experience to let others know what can happen and did happen that particular friday night at your establishment.  that's all.  other people were inside your establishment complaining too about the very long wait time to receive their food.  there were door dash couriers along with regular customers who had placed their orders through the phone(prior to the phone receiver being taken off the hook by the young girl at your request) who were complaining as well.  the young girl that was working the front that night was ignoring me as well as others who were asking about where their food was.  i know for certain that anyone who personally waits for 1 hour for takeout is being more than patient.  i was in contact with the customer throughout the ""wait"" and i did notify grubhub to inform them of the situation and the customer's desire to cancel the order of which grubhub confirmed with the customer.  i would think you would be apologetic to me for your behavior but instead,  you are completely being defensive and unwilling to admit any wrong doing or errors on your end.  in addition to working as a grubhub driver, i get paid for over 4 years now by companies to ""mystery"" shop their businesses and report back on my observations and experiences. although i was not mystery shopping your business that night, it's appalling to see an owner/manager of a business demonstrating the aggressive attitude that you displayed that night by getting up in my face and raising your voice towards me when i was just trying to find out why this customer's order was taking so long.  footnote- as a grubhub driver, i have been offered on numerous occasions a beverage by managers of a restaurant if there was going to be a short wait (5 to 10 minutes) and red robin even gives the drivers/couriers an order of hot fries for their personal consumption.  this is what ""great"" customer service is. maybe, you can rethink how you should treat all people in the future.  at t's place, i got nothing but attitude.",1553244606,"updat detail would give zero star could

to make things worse, the server was 100% aware how small the amount of food she gave me. she had a look on her face: this is what you get (to make things fair, her facial expression was my opinion, but everything else above are 100% facts).  i was so uncomfortable that i cancelled my order at the end. then, an older guy, who seemed to be in charge, yelled at me. what? what? say it!  i said nothing and went to the restaurant right next to it.",1550974304,"worst subway staff unfriend give food ask chipotl steak wrap alway eat chipotl steak wrap come subway got two slice american chees subway give four ask chees got one slice charg avocado avocado price includ price chipotl steak wrap subway server veri care give avocado got one scoop steak subway give two scoop liter got three spinach leav two piec onion sinc ask chees begin felt uncomfort ask food becaus want act like ask much make thing wors server awar small amount food gave look face get make thing fair facial express opinion everyth els abov fact uncomfort cancel order end older guy seem charg yell say said noth went restaur right next"," american",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.4522058,-79.9515886,"PA","pittsburgh","15213","4613 Centre Ave","subway restaurants"

mostly a decent enough bar, but the 5% credit card charge seems inappropriate and unwarranted.

very weird dress code on door seems to target a very specific demographic (no sideways hats, no sagging...)

atmosphere:
radio pop/hip-pop fills the air in this dimly-lit, wood-furnished semi-sports bar, as a few former-fratboy types and late 30/-early 40-somethings chat amongst themselves. hockey, nbc, and local broadcasting on televisions.

cost:
half-priced personal pies cost $4 on sundays, and my irish coffee took $6.25 from my wallet. bring cash if you want to avoid the additional 'cc' charge. your friendly neighborhood pnc atm lives just on the wall of the building directly across the street.

service:
strictly-business bartender, and a trust-nobody doorman. ""cold"" isn't far from the modifier i seek...

experience:
perhaps because it is sunday this st. patrick's day (and everyone drank on saturday) there are no drink specials. was promptly asked for id and interrogated about my condition as i entered from the cold. i located a bar seat and noticed signs covering the usual sunday drink specials on the blackboard. thankfully, the pizza special (my real goal being a chicken pesto) was still being offered (and even more thankfully, red pepper flakes). based on past experience i think i prefer the super mario and the hawaiian pizzas.",1553473243,"star decent enough bar credit card charg seem inappropri unwarr veri weird dress code door seem target veri specif demograph sideway hat sag atmospher radio pop hip pop fill air dim lit wood furnish semi sport bar former fratboy type late earli someth chat amongst themselv hockey nbc local broadcast televis cost half price person pie cost sunday irish coffe took wallet bring cash want avoid addit cc charg friend neighborhood pnc atm live wall build direct across street servic strict busi bartend trust nobodi doorman cold far modifi seek experi perhap becaus sunday st patrick day everyon drank saturday drink special prompt ask id interrog condit enter cold locat bar seat notic sign cover usual sunday drink special blackboard thank pizza special real goal chicken pesto still offer even thank red pepper flake base past experi think prefer super mario hawaiian pizza"," pizza hawaiian",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,40.4509511,-79.9338219,"PA","pittsburgh","15232","5442 Walnut St","mario's east side saloon"

the sandwich i was served was on wheat instead of white, and the fries were a only little above room temperature. i took two bites and had realized it was wheat.  at first my mom and i thought that it had been just because it had been baked or something like that.  when i asked the server if they had gotten my order right she took it back and talked to the cook i assume.  she came back and told me that they were out of white bread for sandwiches. 

i many issues with this.  firstly, why was i not informed of this before ordering the sandwich or even upon receiving it? secondly, how does a restaurant run out of one of the most popular types of sandwich breads? especially on a lazy not-busy monday like when i was there. if you have a staple item on the menu (like a lot of different sandwiches) you should not skimp on how many base ingredients you buy such as bread. i estimate you should have at least 1/8 extra of your average that you sell that weekday. last are the hypothetical implications of something like this.  if the servers don't inform you of the shortage of items while ordering and after serving it to you.  what were to happen if it was a customer that was allergic to the one choice and not the other? would they just serve the item they were allergic to and not say a word like what happened with the white/wheat switch?  i know the issue i had isn't as severe as that as i had no medical issues because of it. however, you need to ask these questions when you see something like this happen.  it could have been a one time mistake, but are you willing to let it be a one time mistake with someones allergies? 

i also have a sneaking suspicion that they could have said it just because they didn't want to remake the sandwich. it was around 6:15 and it was a monday night with the people winding down for the day. this might just be my cynicism talking but it looked like a guy a couple booths over had a sandwich on white.  however, i'm not going to say that this happened 100% since i have no proof or confirmation from the other guy.  it's only my suspicion and should be treated as a suspicion and not fact. 

in the end, when she brought it back for me the fries were cold and the sandwich was still a bit warm from the hot it was.  overall, the sausage was good in the sandwich, but the situation soured my experience to the point i wasn't really able to enjoy it at all.  the fries were undercooked for my taste and were sagging in addition to being cold.  though them being cold could have been my error since i wasted time in trying to get the order right. next time i'll just let my mom go by herself if she wants to try this place.  she seems to enjoy it and would probably give it a better review herself.

edit: forgot to add that they gave us a 10% off our meal for the switch up.  it just doesn't seem like enough to talk about to be honest since i didn't even get the order i wanted in the first place and got stuck with what they messed up.  similar places would have at least either a)given a cheap dessert for free b) comped the meal that was messed up or c) remade it for free to what you actually wanted.  i would have given this place at least a 2-3 star review had they done more than just a small 15% discount (which came out to a little over 4 bucks discount on an already over $30 for just a slice of pizza, the sandwich, and a bowl of soup.)",1546919422,"went dinner mom first time rather empti order italian stallion white choic white wheat season french fri bread serv befor meal came pretti good howev meal came issu sandwich serv wheat instead white fri onli littl abov room temperatur took two bite realiz wheat first mom thought becaus bake someth like ask server gotten order right took back talk cook assum came back told white bread sandwich mani issu first whi inform befor order sandwich even upon receiv second doe restaur run one popular type sandwich bread especi lazi busi monday like stapl item menu like lot differ sandwich skimp mani base ingredi buy bread estim least extra averag sell weekday last hypothet implic someth like server inform shortag item order serv happen custom allerg one choic would serv item allerg say word like happen white wheat switch know issu sever medic issu becaus howev need ask question see someth like happen could one time mistak let one time mistak someon allergi also sneak suspicion could said becaus want remak sandwich around monday night peopl wind day might cynic talk look like guy coupl booth sandwich white howev go say happen sinc proof confirm guy onli suspicion treat suspicion fact end brought back fri cold sandwich still bit warm hot overal sausag good sandwich situat sour experi point realli abl enjoy fri undercook tast sag addit cold though cold could error sinc wast time tri get order right next time let mom go want tri place seem enjoy would probabl give better review edit forgot add gave us meal switch seem like enough talk honest sinc even get order want first place got stuck mess similar place would least either given cheap dessert free comp meal mess remad free actual want would given place least star review done small discount came littl buck discount alreadi slice pizza sandwich bowl soup"," italian pizza sandwiches french soup sum",6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.6513896,-112.2572392,"AZ","peoria","85382","9163 W Union Hills Dr","streets of new york pizza"

(hind site, i wish i had done that.) it looked so good that i decided to take it.

we cooked the pizza on our grill following their directions to the ""t"". five minutes before it was supposed to be done, i lifted the pizza up to see if the crust was getting brown. the crust was beyond the brown color and had advanced to black. the cardboard tray, that was to remain under the pizza during the grilling, was on fire. i turned off the propane and quickly slid the charred pizza on to a cutting board.

mara piccone-we used to order fox pizza from university parkway, johnson city tn weekly or twice a wk. they used to do great job. long ago, if they made mistakes, we call them, they would apologize & fix the problem. that has won our hearts & we kept ordering weekly, generous w/ tips. that changed 2 months ago. i drove on way home, i called.  i'm hearing impaired, asked girl on phone speak clearly, i couldn't understand. her tone became unbelievably rude, she then sarcasticlly spoke loudly. in shock, i didn't say anything & hung up on her. very first time, we didn't order entire month.  finally last month, i moved on, tried order once again. i requested extra tomato sauce on all of'em. pizza delivery arrived; all 3 boxes of pizza was a mess, tossed to side like it was dropped sideways while hot. upset but i decided to let it go. then as we ate 'em we noticed it's not extra sauce, in matter of fact, they all was very very very thinly sauce, almost as if they are out of sauce & they put on what they had left. frustrated, my husband called for me & he filled them in on everything mentioned. then manager lied, he said: i made pizza myself, that was extra sauce. he did not apologize for rude girl or for messing up our pizza. we are looking right at barely any sauce pizza while this manager lied. very insulting.  my 6yrs old daughter cried, she miss fox pizza & she wants to order pizza again. she asked me if it matters if anyone was hateful or if they gets our order wrong, why never come back again. my heart breaks for my little girl but i have to set example to stand our ground because it does matter!  ignorance to disability is not okay, bad customer service is not okay. what i want to know is this, now you seen this review, what are you going to do about it? you just lost $40-$80 weekly from us because of your rude and arrogant employees. are you okay with this kind of behavior and terrible customer relationship at your business?
response from the owner-well i'm very sorry about your past experiences this is the first we have heard about this. it is also very hard to hear on the phones with the oven running hood vent and so on. if you could call and ask for a manger i surely promise that this situation would be handled. we don't know if we're doing something wring unless someone tells us. all mangers make the orders and if someone s orders it a certain way i assure you that it's made the way that's it's ordered we've all been together for 4 years and we take pride in our service.

i advised the lady who came to the window that both of my fry orders were missing. i gave her my receipt, and she seriously acted like i was not telling her the truth, like i would try to get $2 worth of fries for absolutely nothing. like the black woman just game back to get some free food. 
i offered to show her the bags which she eagerly took....she said to me that she just wanted to make sure. 
after acknowledging there were no fries in the bag, she offered to have some more made. after no meaningful attempt at any sincere apology, i told her that i no longer want the food, and i wanted to speak to her manager for a refund of my money. 
the manager came over, and i told her that i wanted to return my purchase. i didn't want to wait for the fries because my other food would be too cold. she did offer to make my order again, but after waiting a combined 20 to 25 minutes in theirs drive thru, i wasn't interested in waiting any longer. 
she apologized, told me that she hoped my night would get better, gave me my money, and i went on my way. 

i was already having a pretty bad night, but this was the final event that made my emotions overflow. 
i had my hungry 4 year old in the backseat begging me for his french fries, and i couldn't come through for him. his last few experiences with resturant chains have resulted in the absence of french fries, and apple slices and to be honest, i am tired of paying for things that employees neglect to put in the bag.

i am on the ketogenic diet, so i avoid fries, buns, sugar, etc.  i'm used to this challenge, but they wouldn't exchange the side of fries that came with the burger with anything except coleslaw.  i asked to switch it with the side salad ($2.99) for a reasonable upcharge, but no.  so despite the fact that i got a burger without their fancy bun, and asked them not to bring fries, i still had to pay full price for the burger meal and full price for the salad.  very frustrating.  

my mom's regular burger was good but boring.  my niece's ragin' cajun burger was yummy.  my house salad was very disappointing.  just iceberg lettuce with tiny pieces of green pepper, onion, and tomato.  (no cucumbers, even though they were in the menu's description.)  i got the burger with mozzarella and grilled onions and peppers.  it was good, even without the bun.  

the atmosphere is really weird.  it's patchworked together in what seems like a former store or office. they hide the kitchen with curtains and wood lattice.  

i really root for local small businesses, but you have to do a really excellent job at what you do to stand above the big businesses.  i'm afraid that this place just doesn't make the cut.  i'm disappointed.",1554147107,"veri rare write negat review unfortun one took mom lunch dure one hour lunch break thought would plenti time sinc right around corner job time food came mom onli got coupl bite burger fri befor leav waitress warn us size burger meant took longer cook ketogen diet avoid fri bun sugar etc use challeng exchang side fri came burger anyth except coleslaw ask switch side salad reason upcharg despit fact got burger without fanci bun ask bring fri still pay full price burger meal full price salad veri frustrat mom regular burger good bore niec ragin cajun burger yummi hous salad veri disappoint iceberg lettuc tini piec green pepper onion tomato cucumb even though menu descript got burger mozzarella grill onion pepper good even without bun atmospher realli weird patchwork togeth seem like former store offic hide kitchen curtain wood lattic realli root local small busi realli excel job stand abov big busi afraid place make cut disappoint"," salad burgers",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.463095,-81.0728637,"OH","middlefield","44062","14895 N State Ave","big bills burgers"

the food at our wedding was unbelievable. rania cooks on site to ensure the food is fresh and hot when it is served to your guests. when choosing your food, rania provides a long list of appetizers, salads and entrees. i absolutely loved the unique options she provided. it was a little intimidating to choose before tasting just because everything sounded so good (because there are so many options, you select initial meal choices before your tasting then can refine your choices after the tasting if needed). our guests have not stopped raving about our food since the wedding, especially the unique appetizers (lamb skewers, grilled dates, thai chicken curry tartlets, and crab cakes to name a few). also, her baker is out of this world. our cakes were delicious and i really liked how i could customize the flavor of each layer of the cake. he also decorated the cake beautifully with fresh flowers.

i do not know what i would have done without rania help and expertise in coordinating everything for the event. we had to rent everything for our venue and also had to bring in the liquor and bars. rania coordinates all of this. at our first meeting, she was able to tell us exactly what we would need in terms of rentals down to the bread bowl. she provided invaluable guidance on timeline, djs, and other vendors. she also provided day-of coordination between all vendors to ensure that everyone was aware of the timeline and on time. i honestly didn???t have to worry about a thing and everything ran so smoothly. it was truly a perfect day and that was in large part due to rania.

lastly i would like to talk about ranias staff. the coordinators, waiters and bartenders were so polite, professional, and attentive to us and our guests. they could not have been any more helpful and made sure everyone had a great time.

it was truly a pleasure to deal with rania. she is an extremely impressive business woman and i have the utmost respect for her and her business. i???m sure you could get good food from another caterer, but rania provides a whole experience that i???m sure is unrivaled. i don???t know what we would have done without her. i can???t wait to have another large event so i can use ranias catering again.",1539564210,"say enough good thing rania cater review thing would like highlight food level detail rania plan amaz staff food wed unbeliev rania cook site ensur food fresh hot serv guest choos food rania provid long list appet salad entre absolut love uniqu option provid littl intimid choos befor tast becaus everyth sound good becaus mani option select initi meal choic befor tast refin choic tast need guest stop rave food sinc wed especi uniqu appet lamb skewer grill date thai chicken curri tartlet crab cake name also baker world cake delici realli like could custom flavor layer cake also decor cake beauti fresh flower know would done without rania help expertis coordin everyth event rent everyth venu also bring liquor bar rania coordin first meet abl tell us exact would need term rental bread bowl provid invalu guidanc timelin djs vendor also provid day coordin vendor ensur everyon awar timelin time honest worri thing everyth ran smooth truli perfect day larg part due rania last would like talk rania staff coordin waiter bartend polit profession attent us guest could ani help made sure everyon great time truli pleasur deal rania extrem impress busi woman utmost respect busi sure could get good food anoth cater rania provid whole experi sure unriv know would done without wait anoth larg event use rania cater"," salad bars thai",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.3798533,-80.0445687,"PA","pittsburgh","15228","100 Central Square","rania's catering"

i called once again the next morning and left my name and number for the owner to call. i didn't receive a call until 2 days later ... and remarkably the gentleman sounded very much like the previous ""manager "" i had spoken too. he told me that he would have the manager on duty that evening reimburse me and that she would call that afternoon when her shift started. never got a call.

food: great, but with limited and good selection.
taste: good. spicy eaters like myself need additional sauces.
